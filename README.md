Adventure.ATX

I used Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, and EJS to create this full-stack CRUD app. It is a database of fun activities to do around 
Austin, TX. It includes all 7 restful routes. I also added a seed route to easily add new data. In the future I would like to
add a login function that will allow users to save their favorite activities. Currently the user can view all the activities,
delete unwanted activities, edit any activity, and add an activity. 

The live app can be viewd on Heroku here:
